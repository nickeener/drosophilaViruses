Embryos resulting from these crosses (as well as from each of the parental lines) was collected at three stages of development: 2-4h, 6-8h, and 10-12h after egg laying. Following standard procedure, three, one-hour pre-lays were collected prior to the experiment (to synchronise embryo age) and all collections were done at 25C. Collections were also made of the reciprocal crosses at 2-4h after egg laying.     To validate the variance decomposiiton analysis, we focused our attention on the primary F1 crosses 765 x 517 and 517 x 362. Estimates of line-specific expression, and associated methods, can be found as supplements to Cannavo et al.","Collect virgins from the maternal line, crossing with the males collected from the paternal line.

"2","ERP017353","Inter- and intra-species variation in the genome-wide gene expression of Drosophila in response to parasitoid wasp attack","Parasitoid resistance in Drosophila varies considerably, among and within species. Among species, resistance evolved in a subclade of Drosophila and was subsequently lost in at least one species within this subclade. Within D. melanogaster, resistance differs among geographic populations and can be experimentally selected to higher levels. While the mechanisms of resistance are fairly well documented in D. melanogaster, much less is known for closely related species. Here, we studied the inter- and intra-species variation in gene expression after parasitoid attack in Drosophila. We used RNA-seq after parasitization of four closely related Drosophila species of the melanogaster subgroup and replicated lines of D. melanogaster experimentally selected for increased resistance. We found a core set of genes that is consistently up-regulated after parasitoid attack in the species and lines tested, regardless of their level resistance.Another set of genes showed no up-regulation or expression in the species unable to raise an immune response against parasitoids. This set consists largely of genes that are lineage-restricted to the melanogaster subgroup, supporting the hypothesis that the ability to immunologically resist parasitoid attack is contingent on these new genes. Artificially selected lines did not show significant differences in gene expression with respect to non-selected lines in their responses to parasitoid attack, but several genes showed differential exon usage.",NA,5,83,"0.060","ERR1662544, ERR1662610, ERR1662540, ERR1662533, ERR1662585"

"5","SRP031477","Transcriptome and proteome quantification of a tumor model provides novel insights into post-transcriptional gene regulation","Genome-wide transcriptome analyses have allowed for systems-  level insights into gene regulatory networks. Due to the limited depth of   quantitative proteomics, however, our understanding of post-transcriptional   gene regulation and its effects on protein complex stoichiometry are lagging   behind.   Here, we employ deep sequencing and iTRAQ technology to determine transcript   and protein expression changes of a Drosophila brain tumour model at near   genome-wide resolution. In total, we quantify more than 6,200 tissue-specific   proteins, corresponding to about 70% of all transcribed protein-coding genes.   Using our integrated data set, we demonstrate that post-transcriptional gene   regulation varies considerably with biological function and is surprisingly   high for genes regulating transcription. We combine our quantitative data with   protein-protein interaction data and show that post-transcriptional mechanisms   significantly enhance co-regulation of protein complex subunits beyond   transcriptional co-regulation. Interestingly, our results suggest that only   about 11% of the annotated Drosophila protein complexes are co-regulated in   the brain. Finally, we refine the composition of some of these core protein   complexes by analysing the co-regulation of potential subunits.  Our comprehensive transcriptome and proteome data provide a rich resource for   quantitative biology and offer novel insights into understanding post-  transcriptional gene regulation in a tumour model.

"6","SRP040008","The Rhino-Deadlock-Cutoff complex licenses non-canonical transcription of dual-strand piRNA clusters in Drosophila","Argonaute proteins of the PIWI clade are central to transposon silencing in animal gonads. Their target specificity is defined by 22-30nt PIWI interacting RNAs (piRNAs), which mostly originate from discrete genomic loci termed piRNA clusters. Here we show that the RDC complex composed of Rhino, Deadlock and Cutoff defines dual-strand piRNA clusters genome-wide in Drosophila ovaries. The RDC complex is anchored to H3K9me3-marked chromatin in part via Rhinoâ€™s chromo-domain. Depletion of Piwi results in loss of the RDC and small RNAs at euchromatic piRNA source loci, demonstrating a feedback loop between Piwi and genomic piRNA sources. Intriguingly, profiles of RNA Polymerase II occupancy, nascent transcription and steady-state RNA levels reveal that the RDC licenses non-canonical transcription of dual-stranded piRNA clusters. Likely, this process involves 5â€™end protection of nascent RNAs and subsequent suppression of transcription termination. Together, our data provide a comprehensive model for the regulation and evolution of piRNA clusters.

Our approach reliably discerns bona-fide PAS from false PAS that arise due to internal poly(A) tracts, a common problem with current PAS annotation methods. We applied our methodology to study the impact of temperature on the Drosophila melanogaster head transcriptome. We found hundreds of previously unidentified TSS and PAS which revealed two interesting phenomena: First, genes with multiple PASs tend to harbor a motif near the most proximal PAS, which likely represents a new cleavage and polyadenylation signal. Second, motif analysis of promoters of genes affected by temperature suggested that BEAF-32 and DREF mediates a transcriptional program at warm temperatures, a result we validated in a fly line where beaf-32 is downregulated. Overall design: mRNA-ends extracted from fly head were sequenced using our newly developed sequencing methods (5'' was sequenced using Exo-seq, 3'' was sequenced using RNaseH-seq and 3'' end sequencing without RNase H treatment). This data was used to accurately annotate the mRNA ends and to quantify changes in TSS and PAS between temperatures. ChIP-seq H3K4me3 data was generated to validate our 5'' results, and 100bp RNaseH- libraries were used to validate classification of peaks to true PAS or internal tracts.

"9","SRP050336","The RNA binding protein Arrest (Aret) regulates myofibril maturation in Drosophila flight muscle","In Drosophila, fibrillar flight muscles (IFMs) enable flight, while tubular muscles mediate other body movements. Here, we use RNA-sequencing and isoform-specific reporters to show that spalt major (salm) determines fibrillar muscle physiology by regulating transcription and alternative splicing of a large set of sarcomeric proteins. We identify the RNA binding protein Arrest (Aret, Bruno) as downstream of salm. Aret shuttles between cytoplasm and nuclei, and is essential for myofibril maturation and sarcomere growth of IFMs. Molecularly, Aret regulates IFM-specific transcription and splicing of various sarcomeric targets, including Stretchin and wupA (TnI), and thus maintains muscle fiber integrity. As Aret and its sarcomeric targets are evolutionarily conserved, similar principles may regulate mammalian muscle morphogenesis.

"14","SRP065203","Silencio/CG9754 connects the Piwi-piRNA complex to the cellular heterochromatin machinery","The  repression  of  transposable  elements  in  eukaryotes  often involves  their transcriptional silencing via targeted chromatin modifications. In animal gonads, nuclear Argonaute proteins of the PIWI-clade complexed with small guide RNAs (piRNAs) serve as sequence specificity determinants in this process. How binding of nuclear  PIWI-piRNA  complexes  to  nascent  transcripts  orchestrates heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing is unknown. Here, we characterize CG9754/Silencio as an essential piRNA pathway factor that is required for  Piwi-mediated  transcriptional  silencing  in Drosophila.  Ectopic  targeting  of Silencio to RNA or DNA is sufficient to elicit silencing independent of Piwi and known  piRNA pathway  factors.   Instead,  Silencio  requires  the  H3K9  methyl-transferase  Eggless/SetDB1  for  its  silencing  ability.  In  agreement  with  this, SetDB1 but  not  Su(var)3-9 is  required  for  Piwi-mediated  transcriptional silencing genome-wide. Due to its interaction with the target-engaged Piwi-piRNA complex we suggest that Silencio acts as linker between the sequence specificity factor Piwi and the cellular heterochromatin machinery.

"17","SRP066864","OBP56h modulates social interactions in Drosophila","Social interactions in insects are strongly driven by conspecific chemical signals that are detected via chemoreceptors of olfactory and gustatory neurons. Odorant binding proteins (Obps) transport volatile odorants to chemosensory receptors, but their pleiotropic effects on behaviors and other traits are not well characterized. Here, we knocked down expression of 14 Drosophila melanogaster Obp genes using RNAi and found that seven had reduced male aggressive behavior, particularly Obp56h. RNAi knockdown of Obp56h gene expression also reduced courtship latency; significantly impacted cuticular hydrocarbon production, with a major reduction in 5-Tricosene (5-T); and affected expression of many other genes, including Or19b, Gr97a and several genes associated with lipase activity. We propose that Obp56h plays a dual role in pheromone production and perception and that 5-T, an inhibitory sex pheromone produced by males that increases latency for early stages of courtship, is implicated as a possible ligand for Obp56h. Overall design: We used RNAseq to quantify differences in gene expression in heads and bodies of males and females of Dll-GAL4 x UAS-Obp56h and Dll-GAL4 x control F1 individuals. F1 individuals with CyO or TM3 balancer genotypes were discarded. Flies were aged for 5-6 days in a mixed sex environment at a density of approximately 20 in a vial. Flies were flash frozen over dry ice between 8:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. and 30 heads and bodies per sex and genotype were manually dissected and collected over three days in a randomized design, with four biological replicates per sex, genotype and tissue.   We extracted total RNA with Trizol with the RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc.). rRNA was depleted using the Ribo-Zeroâ„¢ Gold Kit (Epicentre Inc.) with 5ug total RNA input. Depleted mRNA was fragmented and converted to first strand cDNA. During the synthesis of second strand cDNA, dUTP instead of dTTP was incorporated to label the second strand cDNA. cDNA from each RNA sample was used to produce barcoded cDNA libraries using NEXTflexâ„¢ DNA Barcodes (Bioo Scientific Inc.) with an Illumina TrueSeq compatible protocol. Library size was selected using Agencourt Ampure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter Inc.) and centered on 250bp with average insert size around 130bp. Second strand DNA was digested with Uracil-DNA glycosylase before amplification to produce directional cDNA libraries. Libraries were quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS Kits (Life Technologies Inc.) and Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc.) to calculate molarity. They were then diluted to equal molarity and re-quantified, and 32 libraries were pooled. Pooled library samples were quantified to calculate final molarity and finally denatured and diluted to 14pM. Pooled library samples were clustered on an Illumina cBot and sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq2500 using 125bp single-read v4 chemistry on each of two lanes.   The quality of the RNA-seq data was assessed using FASTQC (Andrews, 2010). Following quality assessment, adapter sequences were trimmed using Cutadapt (Martin, 2011). Ribosomal reads were filtered against a database of the most common ribosomal sequences using fast BWA alignment BWA-0.7.10 (Li & Durbin, 2009). The remaining reads were aligned to the Dmel_r5.57_FB2014_03 genome and transcriptome using STAR_2.4.1d (Dobin et al., 2013). Read count was performed using HTSeq-count HTSeq-0.6.1p1 (Anders et al., 2015). R software was used for further quality assessment and statistical analysis (R-Core-Team, 2012). The EDASeq package was used to plot principal components, and one replicate sample (HRNAiF1) was identified as a technical outlier, removed, and the remaining 31 samples were used for analysis. The edgeR package was used to calculate differential expression analysis for pairwise comparisons between the control and RNAi sample for sex and tissue as well as the interaction between genotype and tissue for each sex (Robinson et al., 2010).

We treated Drosophila S2R+ tissue culture cells with double strand RNAs designed to be specific for these loci. Following RNAi treatment, we isolated poly A+ RNA from the cells, and performed stranded high-throughput RNA-Seq analyses to determine knockdown efficiency and propagating transcriptional consequences. Overall design: We started with a curated list of transcription factors and related proteins compiled for production of a reagent library at the DRSC (http://www.flyrnai.org/supplement/TranscriptionFactorGenes.xls). We ranked genes on this list as follows - Rank 1: experimental evidence of TF activity and DNA binding, Rank 2: experimental evidence of TF activity and predicted DNA binding, Rank 3: predicted/unknown TF activity and experimental evidence of DNA binding, Rank 4: predicted/unknown TF activity and/or predicted DNA binding, Rank 5: experimental evidence of TF cofactor, Rank 6: predicted TF cofactor, Rank 7: chromatin regulation, Rank 8: little or indirect annotation, Rank 9: no evidence for any TF activity. We then excluded genes with a rank of 8 or 9. We additionally restricted the list to the subset of 483 genes with expression levels higher than signal from intergenic regions in an Drosophila S2R+ RNA-Seq study (Lee et al., 2014. PMID: 25262759). We generated a panel of double strand RNA (dsRNA) for knockdown reagents (Ramadan et al., 2007. PMID: 17853882). For 387 loci we used two different dsRNA reagents, which target different regions of the mRNAs. Only one dsRNA reagent was used for the remaining 96 loci. As a control for general effects of dsRNA treament, we used dsRNA against the E. coli LacZ gene as a sham. We performed RNAi treatments and library preparations in 96 well format, and we placed one LacZ control in each plate. On each plate, there were also wells that we used to estimate dsRNA uptake after depletion of Death-associated inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (Diap-1, or thread. Flybase ID:  FBgn0260635) and ensured that cells underwent cell death. RNA-Seq libraries from wells with such high proportions of dead cells were not informative and are not part of this submission.

They form an extracellular gradient with peak levels of Dpp/Scw signalling in the dorsal-most region of the embryo. Dpp/Scw signalling is transduced to the nucleus by a complex containing the phosphorylated Smad transcription factor, pMad and the co-Smad, Medea, which are responsible for the transcriptional activation of a number of targets in specific dorsal territories, including zerknullt (zen) gen. zen encodes a homeobox transcription factor, which is expressed for a brief period of time in the early developing embryo and is required for all aspects of AS formation, including the initial cell shape changes that drive the morphogenesis of the AS epithelium. However, the number and nature of Zen-target genes involved in AS differentiation subsequent to its specification are currently unknown. The only known target genes of Zen are the so called u-shaped genes; they encode transcription factors that control the maintenance of AS after Zen activity has faded away, so they are not informative for elucidating the specification of morphological properties on a cellular level. In this project, we attempted to identify Zen-target genes required for AS differentiation and/or maintenance.
