"3","SRP015758","Genome-wide quantitative enhancer activity maps identified by STARR-seq","Genomic enhancers are important regulators of gene expression, but their identification is a challenge and methods depend on indirect measures of activity. We developed a method termed STARR-seq to directly and quantitatively assess enhancer activity for millions of candidates from arbitrary sources of DNA, enabling screens across entire genomes. When applied to the Drosophila genome, STARR-seq identifies thousands of cell type-specific enhancers across a broad continuum of strengths, linking differential gene expression to differences in enhancer activity and creating a genome-wide quantitative enhancer map. This map reveals the highly complex regulation of transcription, with several independent enhancers for both developmental regulators and ubiquitously expressed genes. STARR-seq can be used to identify and quantitate enhancer activity in other eukaryotes, including human. Overall design: STARR-seq was performed in S2 and OSC cells with paired-end sequencing in two replicates and respective inputs. DHS-seq was done with single-end sequencing in two replicates for S2 and OSC cells.

"4","SRP016875","Transcriptional silencing of transposable elements by Piwi and its impact on chromatin and gene expression","Eukaryotic genomes are colonized by transposable elements whose uncontrolled activity results in genomic instability. The piRNA pathway silences transposons in animal gonads, yet how this is achieved molecularly remains controversial. We assign an essential role to the HMG protein Maelstrom in the process of Piwi mediated silencing in Drosophila. Genome wide assays revealed highly correlated changes in RNA Polymerase II recruitment, nascent RNA output and steady state RNA levels of transposons upon loss of Piwi or Maelstrom. Our data demonstrate piRNA-mediated trans- silencing of hundreds of transposon copies at the transcriptional level. We show that Piwi is required for establishing heterochromatic H3K9me3 marks on transposons and their genomic surrounding. In contrast, loss of Maelstrom impacts transposon H3K9me3 patterns only marginally yet leads to increased heterochromatin spreading, suggesting that Maelstrom acts downstream of or in parallel to H3K9me3. Our work uncovers the widespread influence of transposons and the piRNA pathway on chromatin patterns and gene expression programs. Overall design: RNA Polymerase II and H3K9me3 occupancy, and steady-state and nascent RNA levels in wild-type ovarian somatic cells (OSC) and RNAi knock-downs of the piRNA pathway components.

"5","SRP020645","The genetic framework of the Drosophila piRNA pathway","The animal piRNA pathway is a small RNA silencing system that acts in gonads and protects the genome against the deleterious influence of transposons. A major bottleneck in the field is the lack of comprehensive knowledge of the factors and molecular processes that constitute this pathway. We conducted an RNAi screen in Drosophila and identified ~50 genes that strongly impact the ovarian somatic piRNA pathway. Many identified genes fall into functional categories that indicate essential roles for mitochondrial metabolism, RNA export, the nuclear pore, transcription elongation and chromatin regulation in the pathway. Follow-up studies on two factors demonstrate the identification of components acting at distinct hierarchical levels of the pathway. Finally, we define CG2183/Gasz as a novel primary piRNA biogenesis factor in somatic and germline cells. Based on the similarities between insect and vertebrate piRNA pathways our results have far-reaching implications for the understanding of this conserved genome defense system.

"6","SRP026619","Drosophila Gtsf1 is an essential component of the Piwi mediated transcriptional silencing complex","The PIWI interacting RNA pathway is a small RNA silencing system that keeps selfish genetic elements such as transposons under control in animal gonads. Several lines of evidence indicate that nuclear PIWI family proteins guide transcriptional silencing of their targets, yet the composition of the underlying silencing complex is unknown. Here we demonstrate that the double CHHC zinc finger protein Gtsf1 is an essential factor for Piwi mediated transcriptional repression in Drosophila. Cells lacking Gtsf1 contain nuclear Piwi loaded with piRNAs, yet Piwi''s silencing capacity is ablated. Gtsf1 interacts stably with a sub-population of nuclear Piwi and loss of Gtsf1 phenocopies loss of Piwi in terms of deregulation of transposons, loss of H3K9me3 marks at euchromatic transposon insertions and deregulation of genes in proximity to repressed transposons. We propose that only a small fraction of nuclear Piwi interacts productively with a target RNA, resulting in assembly of a silencing complex with Gtsf1 as one core component.

"7","SRP028120","Stable pausing by RNA polymerase II provides an opportunity to target and integrate regulatory signals","Metazoan gene expression is often regulated after the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to promoters, through the controlled release of promoter-proximally paused Pol II into productive RNA synthesis. Despite the prevalence of paused Pol II, very little is known about the dynamics of these early elongation complexes or the fate of short transcription start site-associated (tss) RNAs they produce. Here, we demonstrate that paused elongation complexes can be remarkably stable, with half-lives exceeding 15 minutes at genes with inefficient pause release. Promoter-proximal termination by Pol II is infrequent and released tssRNAs are targeted for rapid degradation. Further, we provide evidence that the predominant tssRNA species observed are nascent RNAs held within early elongation complexes. We propose that stable pausing of polymerase provides a temporal window of opportunity for recruitment of factors to modulate gene expression and that the nascent tssRNA represents an appealing target for these interactions. Overall design: This submission includes 13 raw data files. Four samples (chromatin, soluble, mock-treated, and Rrp40-depleted) are represented by two biological replicate raw data files, while five samples (cells, DMSO, FP, mock-treated + FP, and Rrp-40depleted + FP) are represented by single raw data files.","Total RNA was extracted from nuclei, whole cells, or fractionated cells as indicated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).

"8","SRP031477","Transcriptome and proteome quantification of a tumor model provides novel insights into post-transcriptional gene regulation","Genome-wide transcriptome analyses have allowed for systems-  level insights into gene regulatory networks. Due to the limited depth of   quantitative proteomics, however, our understanding of post-transcriptional   gene regulation and its effects on protein complex stoichiometry are lagging   behind.   Here, we employ deep sequencing and iTRAQ technology to determine transcript   and protein expression changes of a Drosophila brain tumour model at near   genome-wide resolution. In total, we quantify more than 6,200 tissue-specific   proteins, corresponding to about 70% of all transcribed protein-coding genes.   Using our integrated data set, we demonstrate that post-transcriptional gene   regulation varies considerably with biological function and is surprisingly   high for genes regulating transcription. We combine our quantitative data with   protein-protein interaction data and show that post-transcriptional mechanisms   significantly enhance co-regulation of protein complex subunits beyond   transcriptional co-regulation. Interestingly, our results suggest that only   about 11% of the annotated Drosophila protein complexes are co-regulated in   the brain. Finally, we refine the composition of some of these core protein   complexes by analysing the co-regulation of potential subunits.  Our comprehensive transcriptome and proteome data provide a rich resource for   quantitative biology and offer novel insights into understanding post-  transcriptional gene regulation in a tumour model.

"9","SRP040008","The Rhino-Deadlock-Cutoff complex licenses non-canonical transcription of dual-strand piRNA clusters in Drosophila","Argonaute proteins of the PIWI clade are central to transposon silencing in animal gonads. Their target specificity is defined by 22-30nt PIWI interacting RNAs (piRNAs), which mostly originate from discrete genomic loci termed piRNA clusters. Here we show that the RDC complex composed of Rhino, Deadlock and Cutoff defines dual-strand piRNA clusters genome-wide in Drosophila ovaries. The RDC complex is anchored to H3K9me3-marked chromatin in part via Rhinoâ€™s chromo-domain. Depletion of Piwi results in loss of the RDC and small RNAs at euchromatic piRNA source loci, demonstrating a feedback loop between Piwi and genomic piRNA sources. Intriguingly, profiles of RNA Polymerase II occupancy, nascent transcription and steady-state RNA levels reveal that the RDC licenses non-canonical transcription of dual-stranded piRNA clusters. Likely, this process involves 5â€™end protection of nascent RNAs and subsequent suppression of transcription termination. Together, our data provide a comprehensive model for the regulation and evolution of piRNA clusters.

"10","SRP042020","The exon junction complex controls transposable element activity by ensuring the faithful splicing of the piwi transcript","The exon junction complex (EJC) is a highly conserved ribonucleoprotein complex which binds RNAs at a late stage of the splicing reaction and remains associated following export to the cytoplasm. This complex is involved in several cellular post-transcriptional processes including mRNA localization, translation and degradation. The EJC plays an additional role in the splicing of a subset of genes in Drosophila and in human cells but the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we have found a novel function for the EJC and its splicing subunit RnpS1 in preventing transposon accumulation in both Drosophila germline and surrounding follicular cells. This function is mediated specifically through the control of the splicing of the piwi transcript. In absence of RnpS1 one of the piwi intron is retained. This intron contains a weak 5â€™ splice site as well as degenerate transposon fragments, reminiscent of heterochromatic introns. In addition, we identified a small A/T rich region, which alters its polypyrimidine tract (PPT) and confers the RnpS1â€™s dependency. Finally, we showed that the removal of this intron by RnpS1 requires the initial splicing of the flanking introns, suggesting a model in which the EJC facilitates the splicing of challenging introns following its initial deposition to adjacent exon junctions. Overall design: In total there are 4 different conditions. Comparisons were made between piwi mutant vs control piwi and rnps1 KD vs controls RnpS1","Ovaries were dissected, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and RNAs were harvested using Trizol reagent.

"11","SRP043576","The exon junction complex is required for definition and excision of neighboring introns in Drosophila","Splicing of pre-mRNAs results in the deposition of the exon junction complex (EJC) upstream of exon-exon boundaries. The EJC plays crucial post-splicing roles in export, translation, localization and nonsense-mediated decay of mRNAs. It also aids faithful splicing of pre-mRNAs containing large introns, albeit via an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that the core EJC plus the accessory factors RnpS1 and Acinus aid in definition and efficient splicing of neighboring introns. This requires prior deposition of the EJC in close proximity either from an upstream or downstream splicing event. If present in isolation, EJC-dependent introns are splicing-defective also in wildtype cells. Interestingly, the most affected intron belongs to the piwi locus, which explains the reported transposon de-silencing in EJC-depleted Drosophila ovaries. We propose that the dependency of splicing on the EJC is exploited as a means to control the temporal order of splicing events. Our observations provide a powerful basis to dissect the molecular events that underlie the role of the EJC in splicing.

"12","SRP045429","mRNA sequence data of individual Drosophila melanogaster male and female flies from 16 Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel lines reared in replicated environments","Our primary objective was to characterize the amount of variation in transcript abundance among individual flies with identical genotypes.  We also wanted to determine which analysis methods would be optimal for RNA-Seq data.  To meet these objectives, we performed transcriptional profiling of whole adult individuals from 16 Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines.  We quantified differential expression among genotypes, environments, and sexes. Overall design: We randomly chose 16 DGRP lines for this experiment: DGRP-93, DGRP-229, DGRP-320, DGRP-352, DGRP-370, DGRP-563, DGRP-630, DGRP-703, DGRP-761, DGRP-787, DGRP-790, DGRP-804, DGRP-812, DGRP-822, DGRP-850, and DGRP-900. We collected 8 virgin male and 8 virgin female flies from the 16 DGRP genotypes in three replicated environments to produce RNA sequence profiles.  We controlled the environmental conditions in the following ways. We seeded the fly cultures with 5 male and 5 female parents.  We reared the progeny in a single incubator on standard Drosophila food (http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/Fly_Work/media-recipes/bloomfood.htm) at 25Â°C, 60% humidity, and a 12:12-hour light:dark  cycle.  We collected and maintained male and female virgins at 20 flies to a same-sex vial for four days prior to RNA extraction to control for social exposure.  Flies were frozen for RNA extraction at the same circadian time (1:00 pm) in 96-well plates.  PolyA RNA stranded libraries were prepared by modifying an existing protocol.  ERCC (External RNA Controls Consortium, SRM2374, beta version, pools 78A/78B) sequences were added during the library preparation as a control. For some samples >1 library was generated to check technical variation. We performed multiplexed single-end 76 bp sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000.  Reads were mapped to FlyBase release 5 version 57 and release 6 version 01 of the Drosophila melanogaster genome and the ERCC sequences.  Mapped reads were counted at the gene level.","Single flies frozen on dry ice were placed into each well of Axygen 96 Deep Well Plates (Corning, Corning, NY) pre-loaded with 200ÂµL of 1 mm glass beads (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). We use a number generator function to randomize fly placement in wells of each plate within a replicate series. We isolated total RNA using the RNeasy 96 Plate Kit according to the manufacturer using either vacuum or spin technology (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), with the following modifications. We added 200Âµl RTL buffer to each well, sealed the plates with Axygen Sealing Mats (Corning, Corning, NY), and homogenized flies at room temperature for 30sec using a fixed-speed Mini Bead Beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). We added 200Âµl of 70% ethanol to the crude homogenate, mixed by pipetting several times, and transferred the supernatant to RNeasy plates. We determined and recorded yield by fluorometry and pass/fail quality on the Bioanalyzer. We used Dynabeads Oligo (dT)25 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to purify mRNA according to manufacturer instructions, except that we used 50-200ng of total RNA depending on yield (GEO_biosample_summary.xls), adjusted the volume to 50Âµl with dH2O, added 10Âµl of the washed Dynabeads in a 50Âµl binding buffer slurry, heated the samples at 65Â°C for 5min and immediately chilled on ice. To prepare RNA-Seq stranded libraries we modified an existing protocol (Wang et al, 2011). All steps were done in 96-well format. We incubated all reactions in a Tetrad PTC-225 Termal Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). To clean up enzymatic reactions and size select at any of several steps below, we used 0.1% w/v carboxyl-modified Sera-Mag Magnetic Speed-beads (MagNA beads, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in XP buffer [20% PEG 8000, 2.5 M NaCl, (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)] following protocol (Rohland et al, 2012), except that we incubated samples with beads for 10 min and used 80% ethanol for washing. The volume of MagNa beads in XP buffer and corresponding concentration of PEG in the solution was 1.6X XP buffer for no size-selection (except where noted) and 1X XP buffer for selecting fragments > 200bp. Unless noted, we left the beads in the sample after each step. We used 96-well PCR plates (USA Scientific, Ocala, Fl) paired with Alpaqua 96R Ring Magnet Plates (Alpaqua, Beverly, MA) for magnetic bead separation. We measured RNA quantity with Quant-iTÂª RiboGreen and DNA with Quant-iTÂª PicoGreen (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in 384-well plates, PS, Fluotrac 600, black (Greiner Bio-One Inc, Longwood, Fl) using a Gemini EM Fluorescence Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to manufacturer instructions. We used Agilent Bioanalyzer RNA chips and High Sensitivity DNA chips on the 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) according to manufacturer instructions and visually inspected electrophoregrams for sharp peaks for simple pass/fail calls based on signs of obvious degradation and to check for library size and adapter dimer contamination. cDNA library preparation: We fragmented mRNA bound to Dynabeads at 94Â°C for 8min in 16Âµl of 1.25X first strand MMuLV RT buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), with 100ng random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and 10pg ERCC spike-in controls (Jiang et al, 2011) from pools 78A and 78B (Zook et al., 2012) obtained from Marc Salit (NIST, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersberg MD). We chilled the samples immediately on ice for 2min and eluted from the beads. We transferred 15Âµl of the eluate to fresh 96-well PCR plate. We added 5Âµl of the first strand synthesis mixture [0.3mM dNTPs, 5mM DTT, and 10U M-MuLV RT (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and 0.5U SuperRase-In (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)] to the fragmented RNA in the fragmentation buffer and performed a reverse transcription reaction. We bound RNA/cDNA hybrid with 32Âµl MagNA bead XP buffer slurry, washed, and eluted samples in 16Âµl of dH2O. We then performed a second strand synthesis with dUTP by adding 5Âµl of 1X NEB buffer2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), with 1mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and 2mM dUTP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 10U DNA PolI, 2.5U RNAseH, and 2.5mM DTT (New England Biolabs, Beverly , MA) and incubated at 16Â°C for 5 hours. We rebound, washed, and eluted as above. We repaired ends by adding 4Âµl of NEBNext End Repair Module (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to the eluate following manufacturer instruction. We then rebound samples to MagNA beads, washed, and eluted as above. Next we performed dA-tailing by adding 4Âµl of 1X Blue Buffer, with 1U Klenow 3â€™-5â€™ exo- (Enzymatics, Beverly, MA) and 1mM dATP, to the eluate and incubated at 37Â°C for 30min. We then rebound samples to MagNA beads and washed as above, eluted with 21Âµl dH2O, and transferred 10Âµl of cDNA to each of two fresh plates. One plate was used in the following and one plate was frozen as a back-up. We ligated RNA Adapter Indexes AR001-AR016, AR018-AR023, AR025, and AR027 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to dsDNA by adding 1Âµl of an adapter to each 10Âµl sample and 13Âµl of 1X Rapid Ligation Buffer with 30U T4 DNA Ligase (Enzymatics, Beverly, MA), and incubated at 25Â°C for 10min. We stopped reactions with a final concentration of 0.01M EDTA. We added 25Âµl MagNA beads in XP buffer (final PEG = 13.6%), bound cDNA to the beads, washed and eluted in 30Âµl of dH2O as above. We size-selected libraries by adding 1X XP buffer (30Âµl), washed, eluted samples with 24Âµl dH2O, and transferred 23Âµl of cDNA to fresh plate. 11.5Âµl of the eluate was transferred to another plate and used in the next step; the remaining samples were frozen as a back-up. We mixed dsDNA product with 2.5U (0.5Âµl) of Uracil DNA Glycosylase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and 3Âµl of PCR Primer Cocktail (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and incubated at 37Â°C for 30min to digest the second strand DNA. We added 15Âµl 2X KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA) directly to the UDG digested DNA mixture and performed a PCR amplification with the following programmed cycle: 95Â°C for 2min, followed by 12 cycles of 98Â°C for 20sec, 65Â°C for 30sec, and 72Â°C for 30sec; then 72Â°C for 5min.

"14","SRP065203","Silencio/CG9754 connects the Piwi-piRNA complex to the cellular heterochromatin machinery","The  repression  of  transposable  elements  in  eukaryotes  often involves  their transcriptional silencing via targeted chromatin modifications. In animal gonads, nuclear Argonaute proteins of the PIWI-clade complexed with small guide RNAs (piRNAs) serve as sequence specificity determinants in this process. How binding of nuclear  PIWI-piRNA  complexes  to  nascent  transcripts  orchestrates heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing is unknown. Here, we characterize CG9754/Silencio as an essential piRNA pathway factor that is required for  Piwi-mediated  transcriptional  silencing  in Drosophila.  Ectopic  targeting  of Silencio to RNA or DNA is sufficient to elicit silencing independent of Piwi and known  piRNA pathway  factors.   Instead,  Silencio  requires  the  H3K9  methyl-transferase  Eggless/SetDB1  for  its  silencing  ability.  In  agreement  with  this, SetDB1 but  not  Su(var)3-9 is  required  for  Piwi-mediated  transcriptional silencing genome-wide. Due to its interaction with the target-engaged Piwi-piRNA complex we suggest that Silencio acts as linker between the sequence specificity factor Piwi and the cellular heterochromatin machinery.

While its role in the regulation of posttranscriptional gene expression is beginning to be unveiled, its function during development of complex organisms is poorly understood. Here, we identify Spenito as a novel member of the methyltransferase complex and show that m6A in Drosophila is necessary for proper synaptic growth, and in regulation of early steps of pre-mRNA splicing. Splicing of Sex-lethal and of its downstream targets are defective in animals lacking m6A, revealing also important roles in sex determination and dosage compensation. Finally, we implicate the nuclear m6A reader protein, YT521-B, as a crucial effector of m6A modifications in vivo. Altogether, our work provides important novel insights into m6A biology through identification and characterization of both m6A-writing and -reading proteins in Drosophila and their effects on splicing, neurogenesis and sex-determination within the context of the whole animal.

"19","SRP074388","Cutoff suppresses RNA polymerase II termination to ensure expression of piRNA precursors","Small non-coding RNAs called piRNAs serve as the sequence-specific guides for an adaptable immune system that represses transposable elements in germ cells of Metazoa. The adaptation of the piRNA pathway to novel transposons is believed to occur when active transposons integrate into piRNA clusters, special genomic regions, which encode piRNA precursors. In Drosophila the RDC complex, composed of Rhino, Deadlock and Cutoff (Cuff) binds chromatin of dual-strand piRNA clusters and is required for transcription of piRNA precursors, though the mechanism by which RDC license transcription remained unknown. Here we show that Cuff prevents premature termination of RNA polymerase II by two distinct mechanisms. First, Cuff prevents cleavage of nascent RNA at poly(A) sites by interfering with recruitment of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex. Second, if processing does occur, Cuff protects processed transcripts from degradation by the exonuclease Rat1. Our work reveals a conceptually novel mechanism of transcriptional enhancement. In contrast to other factors that regulate termination by binding to specific signals on nascent RNA, the RDC complex inhibits termination in a chromatin-dependent and sequence-independent manner.

We treated Drosophila S2R+ tissue culture cells with double strand RNAs designed to be specific for these loci. Following RNAi treatment, we isolated poly A+ RNA from the cells, and performed stranded high-throughput RNA-Seq analyses to determine knockdown efficiency and propagating transcriptional consequences. Overall design: We started with a curated list of transcription factors and related proteins compiled for production of a reagent library at the DRSC (http://www.flyrnai.org/supplement/TranscriptionFactorGenes.xls). We ranked genes on this list as follows - Rank 1: experimental evidence of TF activity and DNA binding, Rank 2: experimental evidence of TF activity and predicted DNA binding, Rank 3: predicted/unknown TF activity and experimental evidence of DNA binding, Rank 4: predicted/unknown TF activity and/or predicted DNA binding, Rank 5: experimental evidence of TF cofactor, Rank 6: predicted TF cofactor, Rank 7: chromatin regulation, Rank 8: little or indirect annotation, Rank 9: no evidence for any TF activity. We then excluded genes with a rank of 8 or 9. We additionally restricted the list to the subset of 483 genes with expression levels higher than signal from intergenic regions in an Drosophila S2R+ RNA-Seq study (Lee et al., 2014. PMID: 25262759). We generated a panel of double strand RNA (dsRNA) for knockdown reagents (Ramadan et al., 2007. PMID: 17853882). For 387 loci we used two different dsRNA reagents, which target different regions of the mRNAs. Only one dsRNA reagent was used for the remaining 96 loci. As a control for general effects of dsRNA treament, we used dsRNA against the E. coli LacZ gene as a sham. We performed RNAi treatments and library preparations in 96 well format, and we placed one LacZ control in each plate. On each plate, there were also wells that we used to estimate dsRNA uptake after depletion of Death-associated inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (Diap-1, or thread. Flybase ID:  FBgn0260635) and ensured that cells underwent cell death. RNA-Seq libraries from wells with such high proportions of dead cells were not informative and are not part of this submission.

"21","SRP075582","An epigenetic mark of polycomb response elements implemented by Trx/MLL/COMPASS","In Drosophila, Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) are identified as genomic sequences allowing the maintenance of transcriptional repression in the absence of the initiating signal. Although PREs in Drosophila are well characterized, the existence of mammalian PRE-like elements remains debated.  Accumulating evidence supports a model in which CpG islands function to recruit Polycomb-Group complexes (PcG), however, it is not evident which subclasses of CpG islands serve as PREs. Trithorax (Trx), which is required for positive regulation of gene expression in Drosophila, is known to co-bind Drosophila PREs where it is thought to antagonize polycomb-dependent silencing of nearby genes.  Here, we demonstrate the existence of Trx-dependent H3K4 dimethylation loci that specifically mark Drosophila PREs and are required for the maintenance of expression of the nearby genes. Similarly, in human cells, we find ~ 3000 MLL1 (human Trx homologue)-dependent H3K4 dimethylation loci, which correlate strongly with CpG island density. In the absence of MLL1 and H3K4 dimethylation at these loci, there is an increase in H3K27 trimethylation levels, suggesting these sites can recruit Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). By inhibiting PRC2-dependent silencing in the absence of MLL1, we establish that a balance exists between MLL1 and PRC2, and their respective capacity to maintain or repress transcription. Thus, by investigating a conserved function between Trx and MLL1, we provide rules for the identification of CpG island subclasses serving as PRE-like sequences within the human genome. Overall design: To examine changes in histone-modification profiles and gene expression after depletion of Trx in Drosophila S2 cells, and MLL1 in human HCT116 cells. We also treated MLL1-NULL HCT116 cells with GSK126 (5uM) for 4 days and measured changes in gene expression.","c(""DNA after ChIP protocol was isolated using QIAGEN PCR purification kit. 1000 Kit"", ""DNA after ChIP protocol was isolated using QIAGEN PCR purification kit.
