Flies were mashed using a hand-held tissue homogenizer (Kontes) and a small pestle (Sigma) before clarification by Qiashredder columns (Qiagen). Subsequently RNA was extracted using a column-based method with DNAS digestions (Qiagen). RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols",1,18,"0.056","SRR3032227"
