Among species, resistance evolved in a subclade of Drosophila and was subsequently lost in at least one species within this subclade. Within D. melanogaster, resistance differs among geographic populations and can be experimentally selected to higher levels. While the mechanisms of resistance are fairly well documented in D. melanogaster, much less is known for closely related species. Here, we studied the inter- and intra-species variation in gene expression after parasitoid attack in Drosophila. We used RNA-seq after parasitization of four closely related Drosophila species of the melanogaster subgroup and replicated lines of D. melanogaster experimentally selected for increased resistance. We found a core set of genes that is consistently up-regulated after parasitoid attack in the species and lines tested, regardless of their level resistance.Another set of genes showed no up-regulation or expression in the species unable to raise an immune response against parasitoids. This set consists largely of genes that are lineage-restricted to the melanogaster subgroup, supporting the hypothesis that the ability to immunologically resist parasitoid attack is contingent on these new genes.

We developed a method termed STARR-seq to directly and quantitatively assess enhancer activity for millions of candidates from arbitrary sources of DNA, enabling screens across entire genomes. When applied to the Drosophila genome, STARR-seq identifies thousands of cell type-specific enhancers across a broad continuum of strengths, linking differential gene expression to differences in enhancer activity and creating a genome-wide quantitative enhancer map. This map reveals the highly complex regulation of transcription, with several independent enhancers for both developmental regulators and ubiquitously expressed genes.

The piRNA pathway silences transposons in animal gonads, yet how this is achieved molecularly remains controversial. We assign an essential role to the HMG protein Maelstrom in the process of Piwi mediated silencing in Drosophila. Genome wide assays revealed highly correlated changes in RNA Polymerase II recruitment, nascent RNA output and steady state RNA levels of transposons upon loss of Piwi or Maelstrom. Our data demonstrate piRNA-mediated trans- silencing of hundreds of transposon copies at the transcriptional level. We show that Piwi is required for establishing heterochromatic H3K9me3 marks on transposons and their genomic surrounding. In contrast, loss of Maelstrom impacts transposon H3K9me3 patterns only marginally yet leads to increased heterochromatin spreading, suggesting that Maelstrom acts downstream of or in parallel to H3K9me3. Our work uncovers the widespread influence of transposons and the piRNA pathway on chromatin patterns and gene expression programs.

However, few hormone-dependent enhancers have been characterized and important aspects of their sequence architecture, cell type-specific activating and repressing functions, or the regulatory roles of their chromatin structure have remained unclear. We used STARR-seq, a recently developed enhancer-screening assay, and ecdysone signaling in two different Drosophila cell types to derive the first genome-wide hormone-dependent enhancer activity maps. We demonstrate that enhancer activation depends on cis-regulatory motif combinations that differ between cell types and can predict cell type-specific ecdysone targeting. Activated enhancers are often not accessible prior to induction. Enhancer repression following hormone treatment is independent of receptor motifs and receptor binding to the enhancer as we show using ChIP-seq, but appears to rely on motifs for other factors, including Eip74.

Here we provide a method for high resolution mapping of DNA supercoils using next-generation sequencing, and show that the level of supercoiling is correlated with gene expression in Drosophila cells. Inhibition of topoisomerases, enzymes that relieve torsional strain, leads to accumulation of supercoils surrounding gene bodies and of Pol II at the transcription start sites. Topoisomerase I inhibition results in increased nascent RNA transcripts with Topoisomerase II inhibition shows little change in nascent RNA levels. Despite these different effects on transcription, inhibition of either enzyme results in increased nucleosome turnover within gene bodies, suggesting that torsional stress contributes to destabilizing nucleosomes ahead of Pol II.

Here, we employ deep sequencing and iTRAQ technology to determine transcript   and protein expression changes of a Drosophila brain tumour model at near   genome-wide resolution. In total, we quantify more than 6,200 tissue-specific   proteins, corresponding to about 70% of all transcribed protein-coding genes.

Poly(A)-tail lengths were conserved between orthologous mRNAs, with mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and other 'housekeeping' proteins tending to have shorter tails. As expected, tail lengths were coupled to translational efficiencies in early zebrafish and frog embryos. However, this strong coupling diminished at gastrulation and was absent in non-embryonic samples, indicating a rapid developmental switch in the nature of translational control.

Here, we show that changes in energy metabolism induced by the steroid hormone Ecdysone initiate an irreversible cascade of events leading to cell cycle exit in Drosophila neural stem cells. We show that the timely induction of oxidative phosphorylation and the mitochondrial respiratory chain are required in neuroblasts to uncouple cell cycle progression from cell growth. This results in a progressive reduction in neuroblast cell size and ultimately in terminal differentiation. Neuroblasts isolated from brain tumors fail to undergo this shrinkage process and this may explain why they are immortalized.

The RDC complex is anchored to H3K9me3-marked chromatin in part via Rhinoâ€™s chromo-domain. Depletion of Piwi results in loss of the RDC and small RNAs at euchromatic piRNA source loci, demonstrating a feedback loop between Piwi and genomic piRNA sources.

This complex is involved in several cellular post-transcriptional processes including mRNA localization, translation and degradation. The EJC plays an additional role in the splicing of a subset of genes in Drosophila and in human cells but the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we have found a novel function for the EJC and its splicing subunit RnpS1 in preventing transposon accumulation in both Drosophila germline and surrounding follicular cells. This function is mediated specifically through the control of the splicing of the piwi transcript. In absence of RnpS1 one of the piwi intron is retained. This intron contains a weak 5â€™ splice site as well as degenerate transposon fragments, reminiscent of heterochromatic introns. In addition, we identified a small A/T rich region, which alters its polypyrimidine tract (PPT) and confers the RnpS1â€™s dependency. Finally, we showed that the removal of this intron by RnpS1 requires the initial splicing of the flanking introns, suggesting a model in which the EJC facilitates the splicing of challenging introns following its initial deposition to adjacent exon junctions.

The EJC plays crucial post-splicing roles in export, translation, localization and nonsense-mediated decay of mRNAs. It also aids faithful splicing of pre-mRNAs containing large introns, albeit via an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that the core EJC plus the accessory factors RnpS1 and Acinus aid in definition and efficient splicing of neighboring introns. This requires prior deposition of the EJC in close proximity either from an upstream or downstream splicing event. If present in isolation, EJC-dependent introns are splicing-defective also in wildtype cells. Interestingly, the most affected intron belongs to the piwi locus, which explains the reported transposon de-silencing in EJC-depleted Drosophila ovaries. We propose that the dependency of splicing on the EJC is exploited as a means to control the temporal order of splicing events.

"34","SRP045429","mRNA sequence data of individual Drosophila melanogaster male and female flies from 16 Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel lines reared in replicated environments","Our primary objective was to characterize the amount of variation in transcript abundance among individual flies with identical genotypes.  We also wanted to determine which analysis methods would be optimal for RNA-Seq data.  To meet these objectives, we performed transcriptional profiling of whole adult individuals from 16 Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines.  We quantified differential expression among genotypes, environments, and sexes. Overall design: We randomly chose 16 DGRP lines for this experiment: DGRP-93, DGRP-229, DGRP-320, DGRP-352, DGRP-370, DGRP-563, DGRP-630, DGRP-703, DGRP-761, DGRP-787, DGRP-790, DGRP-804, DGRP-812, DGRP-822, DGRP-850, and DGRP-900. We collected 8 virgin male and 8 virgin female flies from the 16 DGRP genotypes in three replicated environments to produce RNA sequence profiles.  We controlled the environmental conditions in the following ways. We seeded the fly cultures with 5 male and 5 female parents.  We reared the progeny in a single incubator on standard Drosophila food (http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/Fly_Work/media-recipes/bloomfood.htm) at 25Â°C, 60% humidity, and a 12:12-hour light:dark  cycle.  We collected and maintained male and female virgins at 20 flies to a same-sex vial for four days prior to RNA extraction to control for social exposure.  Flies were frozen for RNA extraction at the same circadian time (1:00 pm) in 96-well plates.  PolyA RNA stranded libraries were prepared by modifying an existing protocol.  ERCC (External RNA Controls Consortium, SRM2374, beta version, pools 78A/78B) sequences were added during the library preparation as a control. For some samples >1 library was generated to check technical variation. We performed multiplexed single-end 76 bp sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000.  Reads were mapped to FlyBase release 5 version 57 and release 6 version 01 of the Drosophila melanogaster genome and the ERCC sequences.  Mapped reads were counted at the gene level.","Single flies frozen on dry ice were placed into each well of Axygen 96 Deep Well Plates (Corning, Corning, NY) pre-loaded with 200ÂµL of 1 mm glass beads (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). We use a number generator function to randomize fly placement in wells of each plate within a replicate series. We isolated total RNA using the RNeasy 96 Plate Kit according to the manufacturer using either vacuum or spin technology (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), with the following modifications. We added 200Âµl RTL buffer to each well, sealed the plates with Axygen Sealing Mats (Corning, Corning, NY), and homogenized flies at room temperature for 30sec using a fixed-speed Mini Bead Beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). We added 200Âµl of 70% ethanol to the crude homogenate, mixed by pipetting several times, and transferred the supernatant to RNeasy plates. We determined and recorded yield by fluorometry and pass/fail quality on the Bioanalyzer. We used Dynabeads Oligo (dT)25 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to purify mRNA according to manufacturer instructions, except that we used 50-200ng of total RNA depending on yield (GEO_biosample_summary.xls), adjusted the volume to 50Âµl with dH2O, added 10Âµl of the washed Dynabeads in a 50Âµl binding buffer slurry, heated the samples at 65Â°C for 5min and immediately chilled on ice. To prepare RNA-Seq stranded libraries we modified an existing protocol (Wang et al, 2011). All steps were done in 96-well format. We incubated all reactions in a Tetrad PTC-225 Termal Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). To clean up enzymatic reactions and size select at any of several steps below, we used 0.1% w/v carboxyl-modified Sera-Mag Magnetic Speed-beads (MagNA beads, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in XP buffer [20% PEG 8000, 2.5 M NaCl, (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)] following protocol (Rohland et al, 2012), except that we incubated samples with beads for 10 min and used 80% ethanol for washing. The volume of MagNa beads in XP buffer and corresponding concentration of PEG in the solution was 1.6X XP buffer for no size-selection (except where noted) and 1X XP buffer for selecting fragments > 200bp. Unless noted, we left the beads in the sample after each step. We used 96-well PCR plates (USA Scientific, Ocala, Fl) paired with Alpaqua 96R Ring Magnet Plates (Alpaqua, Beverly, MA) for magnetic bead separation. We measured RNA quantity with Quant-iTÂª RiboGreen and DNA with Quant-iTÂª PicoGreen (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in 384-well plates, PS, Fluotrac 600, black (Greiner Bio-One Inc, Longwood, Fl) using a Gemini EM Fluorescence Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to manufacturer instructions. We used Agilent Bioanalyzer RNA chips and High Sensitivity DNA chips on the 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) according to manufacturer instructions and visually inspected electrophoregrams for sharp peaks for simple pass/fail calls based on signs of obvious degradation and to check for library size and adapter dimer contamination. cDNA library preparation: We fragmented mRNA bound to Dynabeads at 94Â°C for 8min in 16Âµl of 1.25X first strand MMuLV RT buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), with 100ng random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and 10pg ERCC spike-in controls (Jiang et al, 2011) from pools 78A and 78B (Zook et al., 2012) obtained from Marc Salit (NIST, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersberg MD). We chilled the samples immediately on ice for 2min and eluted from the beads. We transferred 15Âµl of the eluate to fresh 96-well PCR plate. We added 5Âµl of the first strand synthesis mixture [0.3mM dNTPs, 5mM DTT, and 10U M-MuLV RT (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and 0.5U SuperRase-In (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)] to the fragmented RNA in the fragmentation buffer and performed a reverse transcription reaction. We bound RNA/cDNA hybrid with 32Âµl MagNA bead XP buffer slurry, washed, and eluted samples in 16Âµl of dH2O. We then performed a second strand synthesis with dUTP by adding 5Âµl of 1X NEB buffer2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), with 1mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and 2mM dUTP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 10U DNA PolI, 2.5U RNAseH, and 2.5mM DTT (New England Biolabs, Beverly , MA) and incubated at 16Â°C for 5 hours. We rebound, washed, and eluted as above. We repaired ends by adding 4Âµl of NEBNext End Repair Module (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to the eluate following manufacturer instruction. We then rebound samples to MagNA beads, washed, and eluted as above. Next we performed dA-tailing by adding 4Âµl of 1X Blue Buffer, with 1U Klenow 3â€™-5â€™ exo- (Enzymatics, Beverly, MA) and 1mM dATP, to the eluate and incubated at 37Â°C for 30min. We then rebound samples to MagNA beads and washed as above, eluted with 21Âµl dH2O, and transferred 10Âµl of cDNA to each of two fresh plates. One plate was used in the following and one plate was frozen as a back-up. We ligated RNA Adapter Indexes AR001-AR016, AR018-AR023, AR025, and AR027 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to dsDNA by adding 1Âµl of an adapter to each 10Âµl sample and 13Âµl of 1X Rapid Ligation Buffer with 30U T4 DNA Ligase (Enzymatics, Beverly, MA), and incubated at 25Â°C for 10min. We stopped reactions with a final concentration of 0.01M EDTA. We added 25Âµl MagNA beads in XP buffer (final PEG = 13.6%), bound cDNA to the beads, washed and eluted in 30Âµl of dH2O as above. We size-selected libraries by adding 1X XP buffer (30Âµl), washed, eluted samples with 24Âµl dH2O, and transferred 23Âµl of cDNA to fresh plate. 11.5Âµl of the eluate was transferred to another plate and used in the next step; the remaining samples were frozen as a back-up. We mixed dsDNA product with 2.5U (0.5Âµl) of Uracil DNA Glycosylase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and 3Âµl of PCR Primer Cocktail (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and incubated at 37Â°C for 30min to digest the second strand DNA. We added 15Âµl 2X KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA) directly to the UDG digested DNA mixture and performed a PCR amplification with the following programmed cycle: 95Â°C for 2min, followed by 12 cycles of 98Â°C for 20sec, 65Â°C for 30sec, and 72Â°C for 30sec; then 72Â°C for 5min. We purified product by adding 30Âµl MagNa beads in 1X XP buffer, eluted in 30Âµl dH2O and transferred 29Âµl of cDNA library to a fresh plate as described above. To assay plate-level failure, we took 11 samples from each 96-well plate and examined electropherograms for the strong signal in the 300-350 bp library target size and weak signal in the 100-150bp range (primer dimer products).

We present a Drosophila model of paternal-diet-induced Inter-Generational Metabolic Reprogramming (IGMR) and identify genes required for its encoding in offspring. Intriguingly, we find that as little as two days of dietary intervention in fathers elicits obesity in offspring. Paternal sugar acts as a physiological suppressor of variegation, de-silencing chromatin state-defined transcriptional units in both mature sperm and in offspring embryos. We identify requirements for H3K9/K27me3 dependent reprogramming of metabolic genes in two distinct germline and zygotic windows. Critically, we find evidence that a similar system regulates obesity-susceptibility and phenotype variation in mice and humans. The findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying intergenerational metabolic reprogramming and carry profound implications for our understanding of phenotypic variation and evolution.

"37","SRP050336","The RNA binding protein Arrest (Aret) regulates myofibril maturation in Drosophila flight muscle","In Drosophila, fibrillar flight muscles (IFMs) enable flight, while tubular muscles mediate other body movements. Here, we use RNA-sequencing and isoform-specific reporters to show that spalt major (salm) determines fibrillar muscle physiology by regulating transcription and alternative splicing of a large set of sarcomeric proteins. We identify the RNA binding protein Arrest (Aret, Bruno) as downstream of salm. Aret shuttles between cytoplasm and nuclei, and is essential for myofibril maturation and sarcomere growth of IFMs. Molecularly, Aret regulates IFM-specific transcription and splicing of various sarcomeric targets, including Stretchin and wupA (TnI), and thus maintains muscle fiber integrity. As Aret and its sarcomeric targets are evolutionarily conserved, similar principles may regulate mammalian muscle morphogenesis. Overall design: 9 samples from Drosophila melanogaster were analyzed in duplicate: control dissected wildtype flight muscle at 30h APF, 72h APF and 0 day adult, jump muscle and whole leg from 1d adult and RNAi/mutant conditions for salm (1d flight muscle) and aret (30h, 72h and 1d flight muscle)","total RNA isolated in Tri-Pure reagent (phenol-choloform), mRNA selected via 3 passes over Invitrogen oligo-dT magnetic beads, mRNA was fragmented using heat and fragmentation buffer, RT was performed with Invitrogen SSIII first strand synthesis system and second-strand labeled with dUTP RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing by the IMP sequencing core facility (Vienna, Austria) using standard Illumina protocols",16,20,"0.800","SRR1665029, SRR1665039, SRR1665023, SRR1665037, SRR1665038, SRR1665040, SRR1665034, SRR1665036, SRR1665025, SRR1665033, SRR1665027, SRR1665032, SRR1665028, SRR1665026, SRR1665035, SRR1665024"
"38","SRP051410","The temporal patterning system governs the malignant susceptibility of neural progeny during Drosophila development","Pediatric neural tumors are initiated during embryonic/fetal stages and rapidly become malignant despite carrying few genetic alterations. However, the molecular basis of this early malignant susceptibility remains unknown. During Drosophila development, malignant neural tumors can arise from single gene inactivation triggering dedifferentiation towards a neural stem cell (NSC)-like state. Here, we find that these tumors originate from a sub-population of early-born neural progeny that transiently co-express the mRNA-binding proteins Lin-28 and Imp/IGF2BP, and the transcription factor Chinmo. These three genes compose an early growth module that is co-opted in a subset of dedifferentiated cells to propagate unlimited proliferation. In late NSCs, Chinmo, Imp and Lin-28 are silenced by temporal transcription factors for timely termination of neurogenesis. Consequently, late-born progeny do not express the module and become refractory to malignant transformation. Thus, this study identifies the NSC-intrinsic developmental program that predisposes neural progeny to malignant transformation according to their birth order. Overall design: Tumors are induced during early larval stages by expressing UAS-prosperoRNAi transgenes in neuroblasts using nab-GAL4. Tumors are then dissected at the end of larval stages for RNA-seq. To investigate the role of Chinmo in the tumorigenic process, three conditions have been sequenced: 1) nab-GAL4, UAS-prosperoRNAi (referred to as ""P""). 2) nab-GAL4, UAS-prosperoRNAi, UAS-chinmoRNAi (referred to as ""PC""); 3) nab-GAL4, UAS-prosperoRNAi, UAS-chinmoFL (referred to as ""PCC""). Conditions 2 and 3 respectively allow down-regulation and over-expression of Chinmo in prosperoRNAi tumors.","Wandering L3 VNCs were dissected in cold PBS 3 days after the 29Â°C switch, during 30-minute dissection rounds.

In the microRNA pathway, such modifications regulate small RNA biogenesis and stability in plants, worms and mammals.   Here, we report the first uridylyltransferase that acts on small RNAs in Drosophila, which we refer to as Tailor. Tailor is the source for the majority of 3Â´ end-modifications in microRNAs and predominantly targets precursor-hairpins. Uridylation modulates the characteristic two-nucleotide 3Â´ overhangs of microRNA hairpins, which regulates processing by Dicer-1 and destabilizes RNA hairpins. Furthermore, Tailor preferentially uridylates mirtron-hairpins, thereby impeding the production of non-canonical microRNAs. Mirtron-selectivity is explained by unique primary sequence specificity of Tailor, selecting RNA substrates ending with a 3Â´ guanosine, a feature not previously observed for TUTases. In contrast to mirtrons, conserved Drosophila pre-miRNAs are significantly depleted in 3Â´ guanosine, thereby escaping regulatory uridylation.  Our data support the hypothesis that evolutionary adaptation to pre-miRNA uridylation shapes the nucleotide composition of pre-miRNA 3Â´ ends. Hence, hairpin-uridylation may serve as a barrier for the de novo creation of miRNAs in Drosophila.

Specifically, retro transposons can disrupt genomic integrity through insertions, deletions and chromosomal rearrangements. Therefore, eukaryotes have developed defense mechanisms to silence these elements. In Drosophila, endogenous small interfering (endo-siRNAs) repress retro transposon mobility in somatic cells. The generation of endo-siRNAs requires Dicer-2 processing of double-stranded RNA precursors, yet the origins of this precursor are unknown. Here we show that retro transposons in Dmel-2 cells produce sense and antisense transcripts and identify bonafide transcription start sites for these RNAs. We determine that retro transposon antisense transcripts are less polyadenylated than sense transcripts. RNA-seq and small RNA-seq upon Dicer-2 depletion showed global decrease in endo-siRNAs mapping to retro transposons and increased expression of both S and AS retro transposon transcripts. These data support a model in which double-stranded RNA precursors are derived from convergent transcription and retained in the nucleus. Dicer-2 processes these precursors into endo-siRNAs that silence both sense and antisense retro transposon transcripts. Reduction of sense retro transposon transcripts potentially lowers element specific protein levels required for movement. This mechanism preserves genomic integrity and is especially important for Drosophila fitness because mobile genetic elements are highly active.

The poised enhancer signature, involving H3K4me1 and low levels of H3K27ac, has been reported to mark inactive enhancers that are poised for future activation. However, future activation is not always observed and alternative reasons for the widespread occurrence of this enhancer signature have not been investigated. By analyzing enhancers during dorsal-ventral (DV) axis formation in the Drosophila embryo, we find that the poised enhancer signature is specifically generated during patterning in the tissue where the enhancers are not induced, including at enhancers that are known to be repressed by a transcriptional repressor. These results suggest that, rather than serving simply as an intermediate step before future activation, the poised enhancer state may mark enhancers for spatial activation during tissue patterning. We discuss the possibility that the poised enhancer state is more generally the result of repression by transcriptional repressors. ""Genome-wide identification of Drosophila dorso-ventral enhancers by differential histone acetylation analysis"" (Koenecke and Johnston et al 2016, Genome Biol): Background: Drosophila dorso-ventral (DV) patterning is one of the best-understood regulatory networks to date, and illustrates the fundamental role of enhancers in controlling patterning, cell fate specification and morphogenesis during development. Histone acetylation such as H3K27ac is an excellent marker for active enhancers, but it is challenging to obtain precise locations for enhancers as the highest levels of this modification flank the enhancer regions. How to best identify tissue-specific enhancers in a developmental system de novo with a minimal set of data is still unclear. Results: Using DV patterning as a test system, we develop a simple and effective method to identify tissue-specific enhancers de novo. We sample a broad set of candidate enhancer regions using data on CBP co-factor binding or ATAC-seq chromatin accessibility, and then identify those regions with significant differences in histone acetylation between tissues. This method identifies hundreds of novel DV enhancers and outperforms ChIP-seq data of relevant transcription factors when benchmarked with mRNA expression data and transgenic reporter assays. These DV enhancers allow the de novo discovery of the relevant transcription factor motifs involved in DV patterning and contain additional motifs that are evolutionarily conserved and for which the corresponding transcription factors are expressed in a DV-biased fashion. Finally, we identify novel target genes of the regulatory network, implicating morphogenesis genes as early targets of DV patterning. Conclusions: Taken together, our approach has expanded our knowledge of the DV patterning network even further and is a general method to identify enhancers in any developmental system, including mammalian development.

The insulin/glucagon axis is well known to hormonally coordinate organism-wide carbohydrate metabolism. The ChREBP/Mondo-Mlx transcription factors regulate glycolytic and lipogenic genes locally in hepatocytes and adipocytes, but its role in systemic metabolic homeostasis has remained poorly understood. We demonstrate that Mondo-Mlx controls gene activity in several peripheral tissues of Drosophila melanogaster, where it regulates nutrient digestion and transport as well as carbohydrate, amino acid and lipid metabolism. In addition to directly regulating metabolic genes Mondo-Mlx controls a regulatory network composed of the Activin ligand Dawdle and GLI similar transcription factor Sugarbabe.

Here we studied a model of Ras-driven invasive tumorigenesis in Drosophila epithelial tissues and combined in vivo genetics with high-throughput sequencing and computational modeling to decipher the regulatory logic of tumor cells. Surprisingly, we discovered that the bulk of the tumor specific gene expression is driven by an ectopic network of a few transcription factors that are overexpressed and/or hyperactivated in tumor cells. These factors are Stat, AP-1, the bHLH proteins Myc and AP-4, the nuclear hormone receptor Ftz-f1, the nuclear receptor coactivator Taiman/AIB1, and Mef2. Notably, many of these transcription factors are also hyperactivated in human tumors. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that these factors directly regulate the majority of the tumor specific gene expression, that they are interconnected by extensive cross-regulation, and that they show a high degree of co-regulation of target genes. Indeed, the factors of this network were required in multiple epithelia for tumor growth and invasiveness and knock-down of individual factors caused a reversion of the tumor specific expression profile, but had no observable effect on normal tissues. We further found that the Hippo pathway effector Yki/Sd was strongly activated in tumor cells and initiated cellular reprogramming by activating several transcription factors of this network.

Here we show that CG9754 is a component of Piwi complexes that functions downstream of Piwi and its binding partner, Asterix, in transcriptional silencing. Enforced tethering of CG9754 protein to nascent mRNA transcripts causes co-transcriptional silencing of the source locus and the deposition of repressive chromatin marks.

Their target specificity is defined by bound ~23-30nt piRNAs that are processed from single-stranded precursor transcripts via two distinct pathways. Primary piRNAs are defined by the endo-nuclease Zucchini, while biogenesis of secondary piRNAs depends on piRNA-guided transcript cleavage and results in piRNA amplification. Here, we analyze the inter-dependencies between these piRNA biogenesis pathways in the developing Drosophila ovary. We show that secondary piRNA-guided target slicing is the predominant mechanism that specifies transcriptsâ€”including those from piRNA clustersâ€”as primary piRNA precursors and that defines the spectrum of Piwi-bound piRNAs in germline cells. Post-transcriptional silencing in the cytoplasm therefore enforces nuclear, transcriptional target silencing, which ensures the tight suppression of transposons during oogenesis. As target slicing also defines the nuclear piRNA pool during mouse spermatogenesis, our findings uncover an unexpected conceptual similarity between the mouse and fly piRNA pathways.

"58","SRP064742","RNA Seq analysis of unchecked miR-998 expression in Drosophila melanogaster 3rd instar larval eye discs","The importance of the role of microRNAs in gene expression and disease is well recognized. However, what is less appreciated is that almost half of miRNA genes are organized in polycistronic clusters and are therefore co-expressed. The mir-11~998 cluster consists of two miRNAs, miR-11 and miR-998. Here, we describe a novel layer of regulation that links the processing and expression of miR-998 to the presence of the mir-11 gene. We show that the presence of mir-11 in the pri-miRNA is required for processing by Drosha, and deletion of mir-11 prevents the expression of miR-998. Replacing mir-11 with an unrelated miRNA rescued miR-998 expression in vivo and in vitro, as did expressing miR-998 from a shorter, more canonical miRNA scaffold. The embedded regulation of miR-998 is functionally important because unchecked miR-998 expression in the absence of miR-11 resulted in highly penetrant pleiotropic developmental defects. We further show that this novel regulation of expression of miRNAs within a cluster is not limited to the mir-11~998 cluster and likely reflects the more general cis-regulation of expression of individual miRNAs. Thus, our results reveal a novel layer of regulation within miRNA clusters that tempers the functions of the individual miRNAs. Unlinking their expression has the potential to change the expression of multiple miRNA targets and shift biological response.

Overall design: We performed RNA-Seq analysis of 417 single adult flies in duplicate or triplicate.  Flies are from 73 different genotypes. Differential gene expression was analyzed separately for each sex, gene expression from each genotype was compared to normalized mean of gene expression remaining 72 genotypes.","Single, day 3-5 adult male or female flies were partially crushed, stored in 100 ul of RNAlater (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and frozen at - 80 oC for long term storage until RNA preparation. We used Mini-BeadBeater 96 (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) for the homogenization of flies. Approximately 100 ul of 1 mm glass beads (Biospec Products) were added to the flies in RNAlater. All samples had the same bead beating conditions which were 3 x 1 minute with a 2 minute rest on ice between each beat beating, which was in 1 ml Axygen 96 well plate (Corning, Union City, CA). For RNA isolation, we added 600ul of RLT buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to each well to dilute RNAlater solution. Total RNA was isolated with RNeasy 96 kit (Qiagen) as in manufacturerâ€™s handbook (Protocol for Isolation of Total RNA from Animal Cells using spin technology, Cat#19504). The amount of total RNA extract was measured using Quant-iT RiboGreen (Life Technologies). 400 ng of total RNA in 50 ul of nuclease-free water was mixed with 50 ul of 2:5 dilution of Dynabeads Oligo(dT)25 (Life Technologies) that has been rinsed and diluted with Binding Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 1.0 M LiCl, 2 mM EDTA). The mixture was heated to 65 oC for 5min in a thermocycler, and cooled down on ice for 1 min. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the beads were collected with a magnetic stand, and rinsed with 200 ul Washing Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 0.15 M LiCl, 1mM EDTA) for 1 min at 1,000 rpm (Thermomixer, Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY). The beads were collected again with a magnetic stand, and subjected to elution with 50 ul of Elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5) at 80 oC for 2 min. The elute were rebound to the beads by incubating with 50 ul Binding buffer, and rinsed with 200 ul Washing buffer as above. The poly A+ RNA on beads were eluted and fragmented with 16 ul of Fragmentation buffer that contained 1:4 dilution of 5X First Strand Buffer from Protoscript II (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA), 500 ng of random primers (Life Technologies), and 20 pg of ERCC spike-ins Pool 78A or 78B (Zook et al., 2012) at 94 oC for 6 min.

Thermocycler was set as 25 oC for 10 min - 42 oC for 50 min - 70 oC for 15 min - 4 min Hold. The DNA-RNA hybrids were cleaned up with  1.9 volume of MagNA beads (Rohland and Reich, 2012), mixed with 0.85 volume of ethanol. For that, 15 min of incubation was performed for binding of DNA-RNA hybrid to the beads at room temperature. The beads were sit on a magnetic stands to remove the liquid, and rinsed with 200 ul of 80% ethanol twice. After 5 min of air-dry, the beads were eluted with 16 ul of Elution buffer. For the second strand synthesis, 2.5 units of RNase H (Enzymatics) and 10 units of DNA polymerase I (Enzymatics) were added. The reaction was made on 16 oC for 5 hours with Blue buffer (Enzymatics, 1X final), DTT (10 mM final), dATP, dCTP, dGTP (Enzymatics, 0.5 mM final) and dUTP (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA. 1 mM final) for a strand-specific protocol. The DNA products were cleaned up with MagNA beads and eluted as above but the beads were maintained. Purified double-stranded DNA was subjected to end-repair with NEBNext End Repair Module (New England BioLabs) as manufacturerâ€™s protocol in 20 ul size. The para-magnetic beads were replenished with 1.9 volume of XP buffer (Wang et al., 2011), and cleaned up as like MagNA beads steps. For adapter ligation, adenylation was performed on blunt-ended DNA. 2.5 units of Klenow 3â€™-5â€™ exo (Enzymatics) was added to DNA. The mixture was incubated at 37 oC for 30 min with 0.5 mM (final) and 1X Blue buffer (Enzymatics). 1.9 volume of XP buffer was used to clean up as above. The DNA was eluted with 10 ul of Elution buffer,  and 1 ul of 24 differently barcoded adapters from TruSeq v2 kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were added for ligation. 24 ul reaction was set up with T4 DNA ligase (Rapid) (Enzymatics) for 20 min at 20 oC. The ligation was stopped by adding â…“ volume of 0.03M EDTA, and the result was clean-up with 24 ul of XP buffer as above. After eluting with 30 ul Elution buffer, the DNA was cleaned up again with 1 volume of XP buffer to make 12 ul ligated products. dUTP incorporated strands of DNA were digested with 5 units of Uracil DNA Glycosylase (New England BioLabs) for 30 min at 37 oC. Then the DNA was amplified with 1.5 ul of P5 and P7 primers (Sequence from Illumina. ordered from Integrated DNA Technology, Coralville, Iowa) with KAPA HiFi HotStart DNA polymerase (KAPA biosystems, Wilmington, MA) in 30 ul scale.

In animal gonads, nuclear Argonaute proteins of the PIWI-clade complexed with small guide RNAs (piRNAs) serve as sequence specificity determinants in this process. How binding of nuclear  PIWI-piRNA  complexes  to  nascent  transcripts  orchestrates heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing is unknown. Here, we characterize CG9754/Silencio as an essential piRNA pathway factor that is required for  Piwi-mediated  transcriptional  silencing  in Drosophila.  Ectopic  targeting  of Silencio to RNA or DNA is sufficient to elicit silencing independent of Piwi and known  piRNA pathway  factors.   Instead,  Silencio  requires  the  H3K9  methyl-transferase  Eggless/SetDB1  for  its  silencing  ability.  In  agreement  with  this, SetDB1 but  not  Su(var)3-9 is  required  for  Piwi-mediated  transcriptional silencing genome-wide. Due to its interaction with the target-engaged Piwi-piRNA complex we suggest that Silencio acts as linker between the sequence specificity factor Piwi and the cellular heterochromatin machinery.

Odorant binding proteins (Obps) transport volatile odorants to chemosensory receptors, but their pleiotropic effects on behaviors and other traits are not well characterized. Here, we knocked down expression of 14 Drosophila melanogaster Obp genes using RNAi and found that seven had reduced male aggressive behavior, particularly Obp56h. RNAi knockdown of Obp56h gene expression also reduced courtship latency; significantly impacted cuticular hydrocarbon production, with a major reduction in 5-Tricosene (5-T); and affected expression of many other genes, including Or19b, Gr97a and several genes associated with lipase activity. We propose that Obp56h plays a dual role in pheromone production and perception and that 5-T, an inhibitory sex pheromone produced by males that increases latency for early stages of courtship, is implicated as a possible ligand for Obp56h. Overall design: We used RNAseq to quantify differences in gene expression in heads and bodies of males and females of Dll-GAL4 x UAS-Obp56h and Dll-GAL4 x control F1 individuals.

"65","SRP067350","A Functionally Conserved Gene Regulatory Network Module Governing Olfactory Neuron Diversity","Sensory neuron diversity is required for organisms to decipher complex environmental cues. In Drosophila, olfactory environment is detected by 50 different olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) classes that are clustered in combinations within distinct sensilla subtypes. Each sensilla subtype houses stereotypically clustered 1-4 ORN identities that arise through asymmetric divisions from a single multipotent sensory organ precursor (SOP). How each class of SOPs acquires a unique differentiation potential that accounts for ORN diversity is unknown. Previously, we reported a critical component of SOP diversification program, Rotund (Rn), which functions to increase ORN diversity by generating novel developmental trajectories from existing precursors within each independent sensilla type lineages. Here, we show that Rn, along with BarH1/H2, Bric-Ã -brac (Bab), Apterous (Ap) and Dachshund (Dac), constitute a functionally conserved transcription factor (TF) network, previously shown to pattern the segmentation of the leg, that patterns the developing olfactory tissue. Precursors with diverse ORN differentiation potentials are selected from concentric rings defined by unique combinations of these TFs along the proximodistal axis of the developing antennal disc. The combinatorial code that demarcates each precursor field is set up by cross-regulatory interactions among different factors within the network. Modifications of this network lead to predictable changes in the diversity of sensilla subtypes and ORN pools.

In mammals, EVs can mediate the horizontal transfer of various cargos and signaling molecules, notably miRNA and mRNA species. Whether this form of intercellular communication prevails in other metazoans remains unclear. Here, we report the first parallel comparative morphologic and transcriptomic characterization of EVs from Drosophila and human cellular models. Electronic microscopy revealed that Drosophila, like human cells release exosome-like EVs with diameter ranging from 30 to 200 nm, which contain complex populations of transcripts. RNA-seq identified abundant ribosomal RNA pseudogenes and retrotransposons in human and Drosophila EVs. Vault RNAs and Y RNAs abounded in human samples, whereas small nucleolar RNAs involved in pseudouridylation were most prevalent in Drosophila EVs. Numerous mRNAs were identified, largely consisting of exonic sequences displaying full-length read coverage and enriched for translation and electronic transport chain functions. By analogy with human systems, these extensive similarities suggest that EVs could also enable RNA-mediated intercellular communication in Drosophila. Overall design: We performed RNA-seq on extracellular vesicles purified from of human and Drosophila cell line cultures. S2R+ and D17 Drosophila EVs were analyzed, along with human A431 and HepG2 EVs.  No ribosomal RNA depletion or polyA selection was performed on EV samples. For comparative analyses, we also analyzed total cellular RNA from Drosophila D17 and human HepG2. Ribodepletion was performed on cellular samples.","EVs and corresponding cellular pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of TRIzolTM reagent (Ambion) and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions RNA extracts were purified with the RNA Clean & ConcentratorTM-5 system (Zymo Research).

We also included the transcriptional profiling of testes and ovaries of gppRNAi, lilliRNAi, and Su(Tpl)RNAi flies under permissive temperature. All data includes induced and non-induced sham controls. Overall design: We used a three-component temperature sensitive expression system by ubiquitously expressing both Gal4 [P{tubP-GAL4}LL7 (FBti0012687)] and the temperature-sensitive Gal4 repressor, Gal80ts [P{tubP-GAL80ts}7 (FBti0027798)], in the presence of one of the Gal4 UAS responsive transgenes - gppRNAi [y1 sc* v1; P{TRiP.HMS00160}attP2 (FBst0034842)], lilliRNAi [y1 sc* v1; P{TRiP.HMS01066}attP2 (FBst0034592)], Su(Tpl)RNAi [y1 sc* v1; P{TRiP.HMS00277}attP2 (FBst0033399)]. We used the same system to express the dominant negative allele of Cdk9 with P{UASp-Cdk9DN}Ifm1 and P{UASp-Cdk9DN}Ifm1, P{UASp-Cdk9DN}Cff1 (Daniel Pauli, unpublished), and ectopically express stil with w*; P{UASp-stil+}Amm (Daniel Pauli, unpublished). Both stil and Cdk9 constructs were cloned into the expression vector (i.e., UASp) and introduced into fly third chromosome by P-element mediated transformation. The Cdk9DN has a codon substitution to encode asparagine rather than aspartic acid in position 199 (D199N) in the active site of the kinase. For the gonadectomized fly samples, we used gppRNAi, lilliRNAi, Su(Tpl)RNAi, stil ectopic over expression, Cdk9DN over expression, as well as two sham control lines, i.e., w1118 (FBst0003605) and P{UASp-lacZ} (FBtp0010276), and all flies of the above lines were reared and crossed under the same protocol.

In Metazoa, TREX is loaded on nascent RNA transcribed by RNA polymerase II in a splicing-dependent fashion; however, how TREX functions is poorly understood. Here we show that Thoc5 and other TREX components are essential for the biogenesis of piRNA, a distinct class of small non-coding RNAs that control expression of transposable elements (TE) in the Drosophila germline. Mutations in TREX lead to defects in piRNA biogenesis resulting in derepression of multiple TE families, gametogenesis defects, and sterility. TREX components are enriched on piRNA precursors transcribed from dual-strand piRNA clusters and co-localize in distinct nuclear foci that overlap with sites of piRNA transcription. The localization of TREX in nuclear foci and its loading on piRNA precursor transcripts depends on Cutoff, a protein associated with chromatin of piRNA clusters. Finally, we show that TREX is required for accumulation of nascent piRNA precursors. Our study reveals a novel splicing-independent mechanism for TREX loading on nascent RNA and its importance in piRNA biogenesis.

"79","SRP074388","Cutoff suppresses RNA polymerase II termination to ensure expression of piRNA precursors","Small non-coding RNAs called piRNAs serve as the sequence-specific guides for an adaptable immune system that represses transposable elements in germ cells of Metazoa. The adaptation of the piRNA pathway to novel transposons is believed to occur when active transposons integrate into piRNA clusters, special genomic regions, which encode piRNA precursors. In Drosophila the RDC complex, composed of Rhino, Deadlock and Cutoff (Cuff) binds chromatin of dual-strand piRNA clusters and is required for transcription of piRNA precursors, though the mechanism by which RDC license transcription remained unknown. Here we show that Cuff prevents premature termination of RNA polymerase II by two distinct mechanisms. First, Cuff prevents cleavage of nascent RNA at poly(A) sites by interfering with recruitment of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex. Second, if processing does occur, Cuff protects processed transcripts from degradation by the exonuclease Rat1. Our work reveals a conceptually novel mechanism of transcriptional enhancement. In contrast to other factors that regulate termination by binding to specific signals on nascent RNA, the RDC complex inhibits termination in a chromatin-dependent and sequence-independent manner.

The Wg/Wnt morphogen reception is essential for signal activation, whose activity is mediated through the receptor complex and a scaffold protein Dishevelled (Dsh). We report here that the exon junction complex (EJC) activity is indispensable for Wg signaling by maintaining an appropriate level of Dsh protein for Wg ligand reception in Drosophila. Transcriptome analyses in Drosophila wing imaginal discs indicate that the EJC controls the splicing of the cell polarity gene disc large 1 (dlg1), whose coding protein directly interacts with Dsh. Genetic and biochemical experiments demonstrate that Dlg1 protein acts independently from its role in cell polarity to protect Dsh protein from lysosomal degradation. More importantly, human orthologous Dlg protein is sufficient to promote Dvl protein stabilization and Wnt signaling activity, thus revealing a conserved regulatory mechanism of Wg/Wnt signaling by Dlg and EJC.

We constructed PolyA+ RNA-Seq libraries as in Lee et al (doi:10.1101/032920 and Gene Expression Omnibus GSE73920) without modification. Briefly, we used Dynabeads Oligo(dT)25 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for polyA+ selection. We fragmented polyA+ RNA in the presence of External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-ins (Baker et al., 2005. PMID: 16179916).  For lacZ sham RNAi control samples we used ERCC pool 78A, and for the rest of samples we used pool 78B RNAs transcribed from Standard Reference Material 2374 (Zook et al., 2012. PMID: 22859977).  We performed reverse transcription and dUTP was incorporated into DNA during the second strand synthesis step to generate strand-specific libraries. We added 24 different barcoded adapters from TruSeq v2 kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) for ligation for multiplex sequencing. We digested dUTP-incorporated strands of DNA before PCR amplification. We sequenced our libraries with Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).",1459,1900,"0.768","SRR3486764, SRR3486850, SRR3487447, SRR3486760, SRR3487104, SRR3487590, SRR3487588, SRR3486844,

"82","SRP074753","An ectopic network of transcription factors regulated by Hippo signaling drives growth and invasion of a malignant tumor model [larval imaginal discs (eye, wing and leg)]","Cancer cells have abnormal gene expression patterns, however, the transcription factors and the architecture of the regulatory network that drive cancer specific gene expression profiles is often not known. Here we studied a model of Ras-driven invasive tumorigenesis in Drosophila larval epithelial tissues and combined in vivo genetic analyses with high-throughput sequencing and computational modeling to decipher the regulatory logic of tumor cells. Surprisingly, we discovered that tumor specific gene expression is driven by a highly interconnected network composed of few transcription factors. These are: Stat, Mef2, the AP-4 homolog Cropped, the nuclear receptor Ftz-f1, the bHLH factors Myc and Taiman, and the AP-1 transcription factors Kayak, ATF-3, Pdp1, and dCEBPG. Many of these transcription factors are ectopically expressed and/or hyperactivated in human tumors. The members of this tumor master regulatory network are predicted to directly regulate the majority of the tumor specific gene expression profile. Similar to networks of master regulators that control organ development and cellular differentiation, there is a predicted high degree of co-regulation of target genes, and these network members are required in multiple eptihelia for tumor growth and invasiveness. We further found that Yki/Sd and bZIP/AP-1 factors, the downstream transcription factors of the Hippo and JNK pathways, initiate cellular reprogramming by activating several transcription factors of this network. Thus, modeling regulatory networks identified an ectopic yet highly ordered network of master regulators that control cancer cell specific gene expression.

"83","SRP075582","An epigenetic mark of polycomb response elements implemented by Trx/MLL/COMPASS","In Drosophila, Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) are identified as genomic sequences allowing the maintenance of transcriptional repression in the absence of the initiating signal. Although PREs in Drosophila are well characterized, the existence of mammalian PRE-like elements remains debated.  Accumulating evidence supports a model in which CpG islands function to recruit Polycomb-Group complexes (PcG), however, it is not evident which subclasses of CpG islands serve as PREs. Trithorax (Trx), which is required for positive regulation of gene expression in Drosophila, is known to co-bind Drosophila PREs where it is thought to antagonize polycomb-dependent silencing of nearby genes.  Here, we demonstrate the existence of Trx-dependent H3K4 dimethylation loci that specifically mark Drosophila PREs and are required for the maintenance of expression of the nearby genes. Similarly, in human cells, we find ~ 3000 MLL1 (human Trx homologue)-dependent H3K4 dimethylation loci, which correlate strongly with CpG island density. In the absence of MLL1 and H3K4 dimethylation at these loci, there is an increase in H3K27 trimethylation levels, suggesting these sites can recruit Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). By inhibiting PRC2-dependent silencing in the absence of MLL1, we establish that a balance exists between MLL1 and PRC2, and their respective capacity to maintain or repress transcription. Thus, by investigating a conserved function between Trx and MLL1, we provide rules for the identification of CpG island subclasses serving as PRE-like sequences within the human genome. Overall design: To examine changes in histone-modification profiles and gene expression after depletion of Trx in Drosophila S2 cells, and MLL1 in human HCT116 cells. We also treated MLL1-NULL HCT116 cells with GSK126 (5uM) for 4 days and measured changes in gene expression.","c(""DNA after ChIP protocol was isolated using QIAGEN PCR purification kit. 1000 Kit"", ""DNA after ChIP protocol was isolated using QIAGEN PCR purification kit.

"86","SRP081149","Transcription elongation has a tissue-specific impact in alternative cleavage and polyadenylation in Drosophila melanogaster","Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) is a mechanism generating multiple mRNA isoforms with different 3''UTRs and/or coding sequences from a single gene. Here we used 3'' Region Extraction And Deep Sequencing (3''READS) to systematically map cleavage and polyadenylation sites (PAS) in Drosophila and analyzsed APA in the RpII215 C4 mutant strain, which harbors a mutant RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) with a slower elongation rate. We found that about two thirds of mRNA genes in fly undergo APA and cis element analysis indicates that fly PASs are associated with downstream UGUG elements to a lesser degree than mammalian PASs. The head tissue tends to use distal PASs compared to the body, leading to preferential expression of long 3''UTR isoforms and transcripts using distal terminal exons. Gene Ontology analysis correlates brain-specific APA events with neuronal functions, indicating their functional relevance. We also found that the distance between the proximal and distal PASs and intron locations might play important roles for brain APA. Analysis of the RpII215 C4 mutant strain, reveals that a 50% decrease in transcriptional elongation rate leads to shortened 3''UTRs in the fly body, but not in the head. This correlates with an upregulation of Ssu72 specifically in RpII215 C4 bodies, suggesting that the mechanism underlying those observations involves another layer of regulation by RNAPII termination factors. By contrast, more significant activation of intronic PASs was observed in the head compared to the body when RNAPII speed is slow. Together, our results reveal that in Drosophila RNAPII elongation impacts on PAS choice in a context-specific manner. Overall design: Fly samples. Fly strains were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Centre and grown at 25ÂºC using standard culture conditions and media. w1118 flies were used as a wild-type strain and the RpII215 flies, carrying the RNA Pol II 215 C4 allele (Chen et al. 1993), as the mutant fly strain.

They form an extracellular gradient with peak levels of Dpp/Scw signalling in the dorsal-most region of the embryo. Dpp/Scw signalling is transduced to the nucleus by a complex containing the phosphorylated Smad transcription factor, pMad and the co-Smad, Medea, which are responsible for the transcriptional activation of a number of targets in specific dorsal territories, including zerknullt (zen) gen. zen encodes a homeobox transcription factor, which is expressed for a brief period of time in the early developing embryo and is required for all aspects of AS formation, including the initial cell shape changes that drive the morphogenesis of the AS epithelium. However, the number and nature of Zen-target genes involved in AS differentiation subsequent to its specification are currently unknown. The only known target genes of Zen are the so called u-shaped genes; they encode transcription factors that control the maintenance of AS after Zen activity has faded away, so they are not informative for elucidating the specification of morphological properties on a cellular level. In this project, we attempted to identify Zen-target genes required for AS differentiation and/or maintenance.

While its role in the regulation of posttranscriptional gene expression is beginning to be unveiled, its function during development of complex organisms is poorly understood.

Splicing of Sex-lethal and of its downstream targets are defective in animals lacking m6A, revealing also important roles in sex determination and dosage compensation. Finally, we implicate the nuclear m6A reader protein, YT521-B, as a crucial effector of m6A modifications in vivo. Altogether, our work provides important novel insights into m6A biology through identification and characterization of both m6A-writing and -reading proteins in Drosophila and their effects on splicing, neurogenesis and sex-determination within the context of the whole animal.

In addition to zygotic genome activation, the MBT involves alterations in cell-cycle length and the implementation DNA damage/replication checkpoints that serve to monitor genome integrity. Previous work has shown that mutations affecting histone mRNA metabolism or DNA replication checkpoint factors severely impact developmental progression through the MBT, prompting us to characterize and contrast the transcriptomic impact of these genetic perturbations. In this study, we define gene expression profiles that mark early embryogenesis in Drosophila through transcriptomic analyses of developmentally staged (early syncytial vs late blastoderm) and biochemically fractionated (nuclear vs cytoplasmic) wild-type embryo. We then compare the transcriptomic profiles of loss-of-function mutants of the dChk1/Grapes replication checkpoint kinase and the Stem Loop Binding Protein (SLBP), a key regulator of replication-dependent histone mRNAs. Our analysis of RNA spatial and temporal distribution during embryogenesis offers new insights into the dynamics of early embryogenesis.
